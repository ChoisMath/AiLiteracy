      s1_p2: "Think of it as teaching a machine to &quot;think&quot; or &quot;act&quot; like a human, but not in the way you see in movies. Instead, it's about processing information and recognizing patterns to make a decision or create something new.",
      s1_p3: "It's also important to distinguish AI from simple automation. Automation follows pre-programmed <strong>rules</strong> (if X happens, do Y). AI, specifically Machine Learning, makes <strong>predictions</strong> and <strong>decisions</strong> based on <strong>patterns</strong> it has learned from data, allowing it to handle new and unseen situations.",

      s2_term3_title: "Neural Networks (NN)",
      s2_term3_desc: "The core component of Deep Learning. A Neural Network is a system of interconnected &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;neurons&quot; in layers. Data passes through these layers, which process and transform it to find patterns and make a final decision.",

      s1_p2: "그 영향을 이해하는 것은 개인의 워크플로우를 넘어섭니다. 이는 시민으로서 생각하며 우리 경제, 문화, 환경에 미치는 거시적 영향을 고려할 것을 요구합니다. 이것이 AI 리터러시의 마지막이자 아마도 가장 중요한 부분일 것입니다.",
